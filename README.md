# Notes Template

Notes Template is a minimal template for Ca' Foscari University courses

It is composed of four separate packages – `sleek`, `sleek-title`, `sleek-theorems` and `sleek-listings` – each of which can be used individually.

For more information about the packages, settings, environments, commands, etc., please refer to the documentation file [`main.pdf`](main.pdf), which also acts as showcase document.
