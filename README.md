# Cryptography afternotes

These are some afternotes regarding the Cryptography course, held by Professor Flaminia
Luccio. Everything is based on the slides provided by Professor Luccio and on what she
verbally explained during the lectures.
Note that this does not substitute any book and is not sufficient to prepare for the exam.
Moreover there could be some ortographic errors that have been missed during the review.
